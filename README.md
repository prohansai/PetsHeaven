## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

* npm
    ```sh
    npm install npm@latest -g
    ```

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/prohansai/PetsHeaven.git](https://github.com/prohansai/PetsHeaven.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd PetsHeaven
    ```
3.  **Install backend dependencies:**
    ```sh
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```sh
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```

### Environment Variables

You will need to create a `.env` file in the **`backend`** directory. This file will store your secret keys and database connection strings.

```env
# MongoDB Connection String
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string

# JWT Secret Key
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key

# Cloudinary Credentials
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret

# Server Port
PORT=5000
```
### Running the Application

1.  **Start the backend server** (from the `backend` directory):
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
2.  **Start the frontend development server** (from the `frontend` directory):
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

Your application should now be running locally. The backend will be on `http://localhost:5000` and the frontend on `http://localhost:3000`.
